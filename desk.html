                        <p class="text-justify theme2"> Towards the end of seventees, three souls, later joined by four more,
                            stirred by their faith, social consciousness and patriotic ferver, initiated a journey to
                            educate vulnerables of the society. This initiative gave birth to the Deepalaya Schools for
                            educating the poor, needy, deserving, marginalized and denied.

                            It took momentum with 5 students on day one, 16th July 1979 - and no looking back. The
                            efforts of three decades returned handsome dividends and over 50000 children educated. The
                            outcomes have been satisfying and is appreciated.

                            Deepalaya School, Kalkaji Extn. is a recognized and affiliated school. To reach this level,
                            one had to undertake quite a bit of struggles. However, the efforts were worthwhile, for the
                            management could uphold and live its value's and could comply with all stipulations and
                            conditions. Hence Deepalaya Schools today standout prominently as an institution fulfilling
                            the mission of social obligation, professional standards and undiluted ethics. Let God
                            almighty enable us to hold on and grow, to reach heights to serve larger numbers, who have
                            “Rights” as we understand our obligations.

                            From the humble beginning in 1979, from a rented building with five children, Deepalaya
                            School
                            has grown both in size and stature. Now we have six schools in three states with more than
                            four
                            thousand students on the role. I am happy that I am associated with Deepalaya from the
                            beginning
                            – as a treasure for a long time and at present as the manager of the schools. It is because
                            of
                            the sincere effort and commitment of the people attached to Deepalaya the present position
                            has
                            evolved. We have a rich heritage, tradition, culture and values which have to be maintained
                            and
                            reflected through education. That is what Deepalaya is striving to do. In the past we tried
                            to
                            keep certain values in our work which we will continue to keep for the improvement of the
                            quality of life. I am confident that Deepalaya Parivar has the ability and commitment to
                            work
                            with and for others and I see a good future through the thoughts shared by them.

                            realising Deepalaya’s nobel aspirations of helping children from the weaker sections of
                            society. This beautiful journey was initiated 36 years ago by Mr. T. K. Mathew, Mr. Y.
                            Chakochan, Mr. T. M. Abraham, Mr. C. M. Mathai, Mr. Punnose Thomas, Mr. P. J. Thomas and
                            Mrs. Grace Thomas. With their guidance and support we have grown from a small seed to a
                            blossomed tree.

                            The school has now received recognition from the Directorate of education and affiliation
                            from the CBSE board is testament to our unwavering commitment to providing quality education
                            and equal opportunities to our students.

                            The curriculum and pedagogy is designed to not only provide our students with quality
                            education but also to equip them with life sustaining skills. We believe that each child is
                            uniquely gifted and seek to provide them with a plethora of opportunities to leverage their
                            potential. Thus art, music, dance, sports and many such activities from an integral part of
                            their education. Students are encouraged to participate in various co-curricular activities
                            organised by Interact Club, Health Club, Eco Club, Computer Club, and Inter House
                            Competitions.

                            It is indeed, very rewarding to see a gleam in the eyes and a confident smile on the faces
                            of my students as they give shape each day to their dreams inspite of their hardships.</p>
